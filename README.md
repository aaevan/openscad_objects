# openscad_objects
3D printable things I've made to solve small problems in my life. Also a caltrop.

All objects are designed to be printable without support structures.

Also included is a script (**generate_previews.sh**) to generate a .png for every openscad file in the directory.
Needs a valid **previews** directory to work.
