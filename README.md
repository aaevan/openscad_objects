![objects](/objects.png)

3D printable things I've made to solve small problems in my life. Also a caltrop.

All objects are designed to be printable without support structures.

Also included are scripts (**generate_previews.sh** and **generate_stls.sh**) to generate a .png and an .stl for each file.
Each script requires a valid **previews** and **stls** directories to work.
